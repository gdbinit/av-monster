Introduction
------------
This is a kernel module for Mac OS X Intel x86 that will search and patch
anti-virus drivers on the fly and disable realtime file-scanning.
Everything is dynamic except the module name hashes.

It only supports 32bits kernels. 64bits is just a matter of adding missing code.

Have fun.
fG!

Installation
------------
Just load and unload as a normal kernel module.

Tested with
-----------
Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and Lion 10.7.3, 32 bits only!

Known Problems
--------------
The code that searches the callback works for all but one AV (handled individually)
but can be easily broken with changes. So it could be more robust, for example
by porting a disassembler library to kernel land.
Or we could just pass the required information from userland. That wouldn't
be so much fun and feels hackish!
The kernel modules names should be stable else we have problems because we
are trying to match their hashes.

Source
------
Created with XCode 4.x
